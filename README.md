This is a thrust vectoring script for the game Space Engineers. <br />
This script allows flight using unidirectional thrust on a custom 360 degree rotating arm. <br />
It works by calculating the thrust vector which consists of direction and length which is passed onto the engine itself.  <br />
I've not made the script public yet, as the use of subgrids in the design requires a gyroscopic stabilization script to counter inter-grid forces.  <br />
While I did implement said gyroscopic stabilization, I want to re-do it in a separate script, rather then have it contained in this one.  <br />
Due to the WIP state of this project there are no video materials I can share on it yet.
